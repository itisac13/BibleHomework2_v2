Changes:

Changed average lifetime.

Changed reproductive rate to 2.3 (each couple has 2.3 babies).

Added a "theological knowledge" variable. This represents the collective knowledge that all disciples have. Its growth is determined by another variable. The higher the value, the more efficiently the disciples can train more disciples, and thus the faster the disciple growth rate.

Now, that's what is supposed to happen. But for some reason, at some point, applying this new growth causes the training rate to plummet to 0. I'm unsure what's causing it.
